## Score API

Score API for 1EdTech (IMS) [Assignment and Grade Services](https://github.com/instructure/api-docu-portal/blob/prod/doc/api/file.assignment_tools.md).

**A Score object looks like:**

```js
{
  // The lti_user_id or the Canvas user_id
  "userId": "50 | 'abcasdf'",
  // The Current score received in the tool for this line item and user, scaled to
  // the scoreMaximum
  "scoreGiven": 50,
  // Maximum possible score for this result; it must be present if scoreGiven is
  // present.
  "scoreMaximum": 50,
  // Comment visible to the student about this score.
  "comment": null,
  // Date and time when the score was modified in the tool. Should use subsecond
  // precision.
  "timestamp": "2017-04-16T18:54:36.736+00:00",
  // Indicate to Canvas the status of the user towards the activity's completion.
  // Must be one of Initialized, Started, InProgress, Submitted, Completed
  "activityProgress": "Completed",
  // Indicate to Canvas the status of the grading process. A value of
  // PendingManual will require intervention by a grader. Values of NotReady,
  // Failed, and Pending will cause the scoreGiven to be ignored. FullyGraded
  // values will require no action. Possible values are NotReady, Failed, Pending,
  // PendingManual, FullyGraded
  "gradingProgress": "FullyGraded",
  // Contains metadata about the submission attempt, like submittedAt: Date and
  // time that the submission was originally created - should use
  // ISO8601-formatted date with subsecond precision.
  "submission": {"submittedAt":"2017-04-14T18:54:36.736+00:00"}
}
```

### [Create a Score](#method.lti/ims/scores.create) <a href="#method.lti-ims-scores.create" id="method.lti-ims-scores.create"></a>

[Lti::Ims::ScoresController#create](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/blob/master/app/controllers/lti/ims/scores_controller.rb)

**`POST /api/lti/courses/:course_id/line_items/:line_item_id/scores`**

**Scope:** `url:POST|/api/lti/courses/:course_id/line_items/:line_item_id/scores`

Create a new Result from the score params. If this is for the first created line\_item for a resourceLinkId, or it is a line item that is not attached to a resourceLinkId, then a submission record will be created for the associated assignment when gradingProgress is set to FullyGraded or PendingManual.

The submission score will also be updated when a score object is sent with either of those two values for gradingProgress. If a score object is sent with either of FullyGraded or PendingManual as the value for gradingProgress and scoreGiven is missing, the assignment will not be graded. This also supposes the line\_item meets the condition to create a submission.

A submission comment with an unknown author will be created when the comment value is included. This also supposes the line\_item meets the condition to create a submission.

It is also possible to submit a file along with this score, which will attach the file to the submission that is created. Files should be formatted as Content Items, with the correct syntax below.

Returns a url pointing to the Result. If any files were submitted, also returns the Content Items which were sent in the request, each with a url pointing to the Progress of the file upload.

**Request Parameters:**
