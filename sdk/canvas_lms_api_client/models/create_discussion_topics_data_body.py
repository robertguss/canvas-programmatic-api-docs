        lock_at (Union[Unset, str]): If a timestamp is given, the topic will be scheduled to lock at the provided
            timestamp. If the timestamp is in the past, the topic will be locked.
        assignment (Union[Unset, str]): To create an assignment discussion, pass the assignment parameters as a sub-
            object. See the Create an Assignment API for the available parameters. The name parameter will be ignored, as
            itâ€™s taken from the discussion title. If you want to make a discussion that was an assignment NOT an assignment,
